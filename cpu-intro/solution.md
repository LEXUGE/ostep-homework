# Q1
CPU should be 100% in use cause all instructions are gonna be CPU instruction

# Q2
We run PID 0 then PID 1 so it's essentially sequential. Hence 4 (process 0) + 2 (io:initialize + io:done) + 5 (blocked) = 11 units of time

Obviously this is poor scheduling as we are not initiating later waitings while we complete PID 2 and PID 3.
